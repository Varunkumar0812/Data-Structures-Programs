* Arrays
* Stack
* Linear Queue
* Double Ended Queue
* Circular Queue
* Priority Queue
* Singly Linked Lists
* Circular Singly Linked Lists
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree

Applications of these data structures such as :
* Reversing of string using Stack
* Parenthesis checking using stack
* Polynomial addition using Linked Lists
* Evaluation of Postfix to Infix Tree traversion
* Infix to Postfix and Prefix conversions

Also includes programs on Searching and Sorting of arrays :
* Sequential Search
